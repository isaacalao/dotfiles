# My dotfiles macOS/Linux

## Prerequisite(s)
### Apple

  * Install Apple's CLI tools

```sh
xcode-select --install;
```

### Linux

  * Install git & curl

`apt based:`

```sh 
sudo apt-get update;
sudo apt-get upgrade; 
sudo apt-get install git curl;
```

## Caveats(s)

### macOS

  * versions â‰¤ Catalina:
    * make sure the default shell is set to [`zsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
	  * `zsh` is shipped with Catalina by default
    * some packages may not work
    * homebrew support for these versions is most likely unavailable

### Linux

  * TBD

## Run

For this to work you must run the function within the directory the `setup` file
resides in. This will run the setup in its entirety.

```bash
setup_initiator() { # Function definition / Callee
    bash setup;

    if [ ${?} -eq 0 ]; then
        printf "Reimaging current environment.\nStatus: ${?}\n";
        exec $(command -v "${SHELL}");
    else
        printf "Deferred environment reimaging.\nStatus: ${?}\n";
    fi
}

setup_initiator; \ # Caller
    unset -f setup_initiator; # Unset function
```

## TODO(s)
[`setup`](./setup)
  * Create setup function for linux
    * WIP
  * Create symbolic link function to handle linking of multiple files/directories
    * Almost complete
